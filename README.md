### Thanks to Valve's toxic administration staff and methods, I will now be dedicating my spare time to writing exploits, cheats and other various goodies and assorted fuckery! Hooray!!!

I'm fuck sick of being an honest player, and person in video games after enduring toxicity since I started playing online exposed to the less than best people.

Today, 23/04/2023 Valve decided to pull a 1984 on me for blocking people in casual and competitive games whose only goal is to insult, berate and tilt others. Upon getting a 24,48 hour and then another 24 hour ban, concluding with a 7 day ban for "numerous griefing reports" and a cooldown for "Unexpected Error" due to one little immature bitch deciding to get droves of people to report my profile. This is really automated, pathetic and fucking dystopian!!! Some of us have bad days but banning me from doing anything and putting this big red warning and window in my face highlighting your BULLSHIT because I reported these shitbags for being racist, phobic etc is NOT on. Fuck you Gabe Newell, Hidden Path Entertainment (you're all shit developers and money shills, including promotion of underage gambling) and Valve Software. Mark my fucking words, this was the last straw! Bring it the fuck on, I will single-handedly cripple your company. This is a moral war and I'm declaring it on you and your disgusting operation methods and ethics.

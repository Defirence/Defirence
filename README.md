### Hi there ðŸ‘‹ Welcome to my GitHub!

ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning Python, Java and multiple other languages, including but not limited to web development with/without frameworks such as RubyOnRails, Django(Python), Spring(Java) including CI/CD, DevOps, Automation and a lot more.

ðŸ’¬ Ask me about:

* Bash, Batch, Python scripting.
* HTML(pre-5,5), CSS, nginx
* nix (UNIX, FreeBSD, Linux)
* Android (ROM Flashing, Unlocking OEM + flashing custom bootloaders, flashing custom recovery ROM, rooting, Xposed Framework + Modules etc...)
* Oracle RLDB SQL + RedHat Enterprise Linux
* Containerization (Docker, Kubernetes+), Orchestration (GKE, EKS, Rancher, Terraform)
* Infrastructure as Code, DevOps as Code, Dev Environments as Code (Terraform/Opta, Gitpods)
* AWS/GCP/Cloud + Bare metal hardware.
* Anything that could pose a good challenge!

ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on some cool WebDev/Fullstack, Python, Java and Ruby projects using lightweight frameworks and Gitpods, watch this space for future developments.

ðŸ”‘ GPG Public Key (Personal GitHub + GitLab):

```
pub rsa4096/BCD619443BDA19B4 2022-04-18 [expires: 2023-04-18]

Key fingerprint = C02D 33B6 5AC5 B2EE 6AE3  AC5F BCD6 1944 3BDA 19B4 

GPG Key ID GitHub: BCD619443BDA19B4
```

ðŸ“’ **GitNotes**:

**GitNotes** are a small lightweight and personal way I like to track things, it's simply directories in a repo that contain text files which can then be referenced on a GitHub Page. 

- P.S No rights/licence infringement are intended if this product name exists for something already, please raise an Issue/PR if this needs to be changed.

Previous GPG key broke so commits flagged as unverified pre 18-04-2022 are still valid since I managed to creatively break GPG + Git key signing which you can find details on here: [Breaking GPG2 + Git Key Signing (WIP Article, broken link)](https://defirence.github.io/gitnotes/break-pgp-2022-04-17)
